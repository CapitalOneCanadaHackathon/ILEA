# Web Application
The web application is made of pure JS, the reason the application itself uses JS because it does not use any server resources. Our goal is not to make this application hard to use and put charity web host in stress. Therefore;The server will have a cron job which will update a json file that gets information from the Database everyday, which is used by the web application to generate Q/A for the users. These information gets sent back to the database for report generation.The questions are randomly chosen from a set, therefore the sets will be different. At the end of the quiz, users are presented with list of questions that they have gotten wrong and correct facts are given.
